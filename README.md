## 👩‍💻 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on  
Machine learning–driven applications, data analytics dashboards, and backend automation using **Python, Streamlit, and Odoo**.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Applied machine learning projects, NLP systems, data science tools, and **Odoo module development** involving real-world business workflows.

🤝 I’m looking for help with  
Deploying and scaling ML models, optimizing ML pipelines, and integrating machine learning solutions into **Odoo ERP and web-based systems**.

🌱 I’m currently learning  
Advanced machine learning techniques, NLP, feature engineering, and **Odoo backend architecture (ORM, QWeb, OWL, automation workflows)**.

💬 Ask me about  
Python, machine learning fundamentals, NLP (OCR-based Urdu text extraction), Streamlit dashboards, backend APIs, and Odoo customization.

⚡ Fun fact  
I enjoy turning ML ideas into **practical business solutions** by integrating them into backend systems and ERP workflows.
